Welcome to Values Calculator!

This basic calculator comes with the added feature of saving and re-using the user's values. 

At the bottom of the app you'll see a button labeled "My Values". 
Clicking on this button will prompt a BottomSheet drawer which allows users to:
- Add new values to use later
- Reuse previously saved values
- Delete previously saved values

Clicking the values automatically populates in the calculator for easy computations..
